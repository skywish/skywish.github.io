Building github page using [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), there are some tips I can use.

{% include toc %}

### Config environment

#### Windows

- Download rubyinstaller and DevKit from [rubyinstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).  

- Run rubyinstaller, and run DevKit to extract it somewhere (permanent). Then cd to it, run `ruby dk.rb init` and `ruby dk.rb install` to bind it to ruby installations in your path.

- Install `gem` by `gem update --system`, install `jekyll` by `gem install jekyll`, install bundler by `gem install bundler`

- Update bundle by `bundle update`


### Create table of contents

Add `% include toc %` into `{...}` at the beginning of the `.md` files.

### Run Jekyll

It's my first time to use Jekyll to build a webpage. I'm just a beginner. The following codes are some really simple but really important codes I need to remember.

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Change font size

**Change page content font size**: go to `/_sass/_page.scss`, and find the following codes. `p` refers to the content font size.

```css
  p, li, dl {
    font-size: 0.8em;
  }
```

**Change code font size**: go to `/_sass/_syntax.scss`, and find following codes.

```css
div.highlighter-rouge,
figure.highlight {
  font-size: 0.5em;
}
```
